- 👋 Hi, I’m @khronoe
- 👀 I’m interested in ... coding, tech, gaming of many varieties
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Git
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... at the moment, nothing
- 📫 How to reach me ... currently no way, I'm a curmudgeon hermit.  I'm creating this because Git insists I do it no matter how much I argue with the silly cat.
